# Local development environment variables (copy to `.env`)
#
# Railway Postgres:
# - Prefer the *public* connection string if running locally.
# - In Railway, this is often exposed as DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL (or shown in the plugin's "Connect" section).
#
# Example:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname

PORT=3000

# Use Railway Postgres data from your local server:
DATABASE_URL=

# SSL is typically required for managed Postgres providers (Railway, Neon, Supabase, etc).
# Set to "false" only if you're connecting to a local Postgres instance without SSL.
DATABASE_SSL=true
